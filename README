= S2S

peer 2 peer directory share, for ruby (Shoes) snipplets

==Presentation

A simple p2p application, made for distribute little ruby applications.
GUI is made with Green-Shoes

P2p part is based on an old 9 lines LOC shoed by _why.
So this tool is made in souvenir of him.


== Usage

Run a client with green-shoes Gui:
  > ruby s2s.rb

Run a client without gui: in CLI (no dependency, only ruby 1.9)
  > ruby p2p.rb

Run a 'server' (no dependency , only ruby 1.9) :
  > ruby p2p.rb  shoerdev server  druby://<myip>/:50500  ...other serveurs....

== Principes

The application try to maintain in each client the same directory content : 
- sub directorys, 
- ruby files 
- images rasters
- .txt files

So all clients on the net should have a directory which have exatly the same content.
files types and sizes are limited (size limit: 10KB).
If someone copy a file in his shared-directory, this file will be copied to all other member.

2 types of applications :
- *server* : a application which memorize the liste of applications actives, and can give this list to anyone
- *client* : a application share his files with all other client. a *client* is *server* : it keep a list of all client, so a client is a server too.

So servers are useful only at clients startup.
A server is running at homeregis.dyndns.org, so by default, all client take this one as server,
but anybody can run server, it will enter in the ring.


== Requirements

Ruby (1.9.2 for gui), 

Green-shoes for GUI

Chipmunk Windows (so linux seem not supported for GUI)

Access to internet  whithout proxy (but it  work on a isolated LAN, run a default server in the LAN)

If firewall :
  
 Create a rule for autorisation on port 50500..50510 for TCP/UDP (for your process ruby)
